It implements the Keras model interface with common methods like `compile()`, `fit()`, and `evaluate()` that are used to train and run the model. We'll cover these functions soon, but first let's start looking at the layers of the model.\n",

    "The first (hidden) layer from above, `model.add(Dense(32, input_dim=X.shape[1]))`, creates 32 nodes which each expect to receive 2-element vectors as inputs.

We'll specify the loss function to be `categorical_crossentropy` which can be used when there are only two classes, and specify `adam` as the optimizer (which is a reasonable default when speed is a priority). And finally, we can specify what metrics we want to evaluate the model with. Here we'll use `accuracy`."
